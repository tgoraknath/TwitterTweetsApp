# Project 3 - *TwitterTweetsApp*

**Twitter Tweets** is an android app that allows a user to view his Twitter timeline and post a new tweet. The app utilizes [Twitter REST API](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public).

Time spent: **24** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ]	User can **sign in to Twitter** using OAuth login
* [ ]	User can **view tweets from their home timeline**
  * [ ] User is displayed the username, name, and body for each tweet
  * [ ] User is displayed the [relative timestamp](https://gist.github.com/nesquena/f786232f5ef72f6e10a7) for each tweet "8m", "7h"
  * [ ] User can view more tweets as they scroll with [infinite pagination](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Endless-Scrolling-with-AdapterViews-and-RecyclerView). Number of tweets is unlimited.
    However there are [Twitter Api Rate Limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limiting) in place.
* [ ] User can **compose and post a new tweet**
  * [ ] User can click a “Compose” icon in the Action Bar on the top right
  * [ ] User can then enter a new tweet and post this to twitter

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] User can **see a counter with total number of characters left for tweet** on compose tweet page
